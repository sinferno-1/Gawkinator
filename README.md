# Gawkinator

## Project Overview

Gawkinator is a web application designed to collect and log detailed client information for ad click fraud analysis. The project includes a sample HTML .. file that gathers various client data and a server that logs this data, enriched with additional IP information, to a JSON file.

The combination of the client code and server code is used to generate and store the attributes generated by clicking on the advertisement link.

These logs can be used as evidence or can be used to perform security and
audit-related tasks.

## Features

- Gathers detailed client information including IP address, location, device details, and browser characteristics.
- Enriches IP data with additional information from an external API.
- Logs all collected data to a JSON file for further analysis.

## Data Logging

The combination of the client code and server code is used to generate and store the attributes generated by clicking on the advertisement link.

These logs can be used as evidence or can be used to perform security and
audit-related tasks.
